# Logistic Regression


Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, used when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.

Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression function and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called the sigmoid function ùúé:
# Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

* Use scikit Logistic Regression to classify
* Understand confusion matrix

# What is the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?¬∂
While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the most probable class for that data point. For this, we use Logistic Regression.

# About the dataset
We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.
This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

The dataset includes information about:

* Customers who left within the last month ‚Äì the column is called Churn
* Services that each customer has signed up for ‚Äì phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
* Customer account information ‚Äì how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
* Demographic info about customers ‚Äì gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
